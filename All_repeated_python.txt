1) What is Decorators ?
Ans)
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or classes, 
adding functionality without changing their source code.

syntax:
---------
@decorator_name

example:
------------
def greet_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Hello !")
        func()
        print("Good Bye !")
    return wrapper

@greet_decorator
def say_name():
    print("I am Gopal !")

say_name()

2) What is shallow copy and deep copy in Python?
Ans)
    Shallow copy creates a new object, but does not recursively copy nested objects (it copies references).
    Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects, including nested ones.

Example:
--------
    import copy

    # Original list with nested list
    original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
    
    # Shallow copy
    shallow = copy.copy(original)
    
    # Deep copy
    deep = copy.deepcopy(original)
    
    # Modifying the nested list in shallow copy
    shallow[2][0] = 99
    
    # Modifying the nested list in deep copy
    deep[2][0] = 88
    
    # Output to show the differences
    print("Original:", original) # Shallow copy affects this
    print("Shallow:", shallow)   # Changes in nested list reflect here
    print("Deep:", deep)         # Deep copy remains unaffected

3) Can you explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?
Ans) 
    Shallow Copy:
        1. Copies the outer object, but not nested objects (references original nested objects).
        2. Uses copy() method or copy.copy() function.
        3. Changes to mutable nested objects affect the original object.
    Deep Copy:
        1. Copies both the outer object and all nested objects (recursively).
        2. Uses copy.deepcopy() function.
        3. Changes to nested objects do not affect the original object.

4) What is Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) 
Ans) 
   Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism used in Python to synchronize the execution of threads.
   It ensures that only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core processors

5) What is indexing in database?
Ans) Indexing in a database is a data structure technique used to quickly locate
     and access data without having to search every row in a table, improving query performance.

6) what is Garbage collection
Ans)
    Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by a program.
    It helps prevent memory leaks, optimize memory usage, and ensure efficient memory allocation for the program.

7) What is the Python map() function?
Ans) The map() function executes a specified function for each item in a given iterable (list, tuple etc). 
         The item is sent to the function as a parameter.
Syntax:
---------
map(function, iterable)
parameters:
-----------
function: It is a function in which a map passes each item of the iterable.
iterable: It is a sequence, collection or an iterator object which is to be mapped.
Example:
-----------
# Python example program for map() function

def Square(n):
    return n**2
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
result = map(Square, numbers)
print(list(result));  # o/p: [100, 400, 900, 1600, 2500, 3600]

8) What is Python Lambda ?
Ans) A Lambda function is small anonymous function.
      A Lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. 
      syntax: lambda argument:expression
      -------
      Example:
      ----------
      add = lambda x, y: x + y
      result = add(3, 5)
      print(result)

9) Reversed method
Ans) 
# Method:1
---------
string = "Gopal"
reversed_string = "".join(reversed(string))
print(reversed_string)

# Method:1.1
--------------
string = "Gopal"
reversed_string = ""
for char in string:
    reversed_string = char + reversed_string
print(reversed_string)

# Method:1.2
-------------
string = "Gopal"
result = string[::-1]
print(result)

# Method:2
----------
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_num = "".join(map(str, reversed(num)))
print(list(reversed_num))

# Method: 2.1
------------
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_num = []
for i in range(len(num)-1, -1, -1):  # Start from the last index and go backwards
    reversed_num.append(num[i])  # Append the elements to the new list
print(reversed_num)

# Method: 2.2
--------------
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = num[::-1]
print(result)

10) Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term
Ans)
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b

# Input the number of terms
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))
fibonacci(n)

o/p:
-----
Enter Number : 9
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 

11)list comprehension in Python
Ans)
Square_num = [x*x for x in range(1,11)]
print(Square_num)  o/p: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

12) What is generator in python ?
Ans)
A generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator, which yields a sequence of values one at a time using the yield keyword.

Example:
------------
def count_up_to(n):
    count = 1
    while count <= n:
        yield count
        count += 1

# Get dynamic input from the user
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
gen = count_up_to(n)
print(list(gen))         # Output: [1, 2, 3, ..., n]

13) What is Multi-Threading in python ?
Ans) 
Multi-threading in Python is a concurrent execution technique that allows multiple threads to run
 in parallel within a single process, improving the efficiency of I/O-bound tasks.
 Benefits to using multithreading in Python:
    1. Improved performance
    2. Increased responsiveness
    3. Improved resource utilization

14) Difference Between Array and List in Python
Ans)
List
-------
1. The list can store the value of different types.
2. The list cannot handle the direct arithmetic operations. 
3. We need to import the array before work with the array. 
4. The lists are less compatible than the array to store the data.
5. It consumes a large memory.
6. We can print the entire list using explicit looping. 

Arrays
------
1. It can only consist of value of same type.
2. It can directly handle arithmetic operations.
3. The lists are the build-in data structure so we don't need to import it.
4. An array are much compatible than the list.
5. It is a more compact in memory size comparatively list.
6. wE can print the entire list without using explicit looking.

15) Difference Between List and Tuple
Ans
---
List
------
• Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.
• Lists are slower than tuples.
• Lists Consume more memory.
• Lists have several built-in methods
• The List is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion
• Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]

Tuple
------
• Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can't be edited).
• Tuples are faster than list.
• Tuple consumes less memory
• Tuple does not have many built-in methods
• Tuple data type is well-suited for element access.
• Syntax: tup_1 = (10, "Chelsea", 20)

16) What is difference between mutable and immutable objects
Mutable
--------
• Mutable Can be modified after creation.
• Mutable slower to access
• Mutable consumes more memory due to mutability.
• Dictionary, Sets, Lists

  Example:
  --------
    Dictionary : 
    -------------
        country_capitals = {
            "United States": "Washington D.C.", 
            "Italy": "Rome", 
            "England": "London"
        }
   
    Sets : 
    -------
      my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      print(my_set)
      o/p: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

    List :
    -------
      age = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
      print(age)
      o/p : [1,2,3,4,5,6] 
   
Immutable
----------
• Immutable Cannot be modified after creation.
• Immutable quicker to access
• Immutable consumes less memory.
• str, tuple,Int,float, bool, frozenset, bytes

    > Lists,tuple,str,bytes = Ordered
    > Dictionary,Sets,frozenset = Unordered

17) Difference between SQL and NOSQL 
SQL
-------
• SQL databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
• SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.
• SQL databases are vertically scalable.
• SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.
• SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.
• MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.

NOSQL
-------
• NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system
• NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.
• NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
• NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.
• NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.
• MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database

18) What is a Python interpreter ?
Ans) The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line,
      converting it into machine code for the computer to understand and execute.
